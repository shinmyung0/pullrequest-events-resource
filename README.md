# pullrequest-events-resource [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/shinmyung0/pullrequest-events-resource.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/shinmyung0/pullrequest-events-resource)

This is Concourse [resource][concourse-resource] that fetches pull requests that have been `MERGED` or `CLOSED` recently.
This is meant to address the use case of pipelines [triggering on merge or close][git-issue] which are not supported within the excellent
[`github-pullrequest-resource`][gpr]. This resource does not do any sort of `git clone` from git. 
It is rather meant to provide information about merged or closed pull request branches to trigger downstream jobs.


**This resource currently only supports Github**

# Behavior

- `check`: check for recently merged or closed pull requests

This will output versions that look like this:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTcxMjQ5NjI1",
    "cursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK5MjAxOC0wMi0yNVQxMjozNDo0NC0wODowMM4KNQ/Z",
    "number": "1",
    "url": "https://github.com/shinmyung0/fixture-repo/pull/1",
    "baseBranch": "master",
    "headBranch": "test-merged-branch",
    "state": "MERGED",
    "timestamp": "2018-02-25T20:34:44Z"
  },
  {
    "id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTcxMjQ5NzQw",
    "cursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK5MjAxOC0wMi0yNVQxMjozNjoxNi0wODowMM4KNRBM",
    "number": "2",
    "url": "https://github.com/shinmyung0/fixture-repo/pull/2",
    "baseBranch": "master",
    "headBranch": "test-closed-branch",
    "state": "CLOSED",
    "timestamp": "2018-02-25T20:36:16Z"
  }
]

```


- `in`: Given a version, will output that JSON object to `$output_dir/pull_request` JSON file.

`$output_dir/pull_request` file example:
```json
{
  "id": "MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTcxMjQ5NzQw",
  "cursor": "Y3Vyc29yOnYyOpK5MjAxOC0wMi0yNVQxMjozNjoxNi0wODowMM4KNRBM",
  "number": "2",
  "url": "https://github.com/shinmyung0/fixture-repo/pull/2",
  "baseBranch": "master",
  "headBranch": "test-closed-branch",
  "state": "CLOSED",
  "timestamp": "2018-02-25T20:36:16Z"
}
```


- `out`: Not implemented.
